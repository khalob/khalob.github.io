			<h2>Flesh Flood Through Time</h2>
			<p>
				Flesh Flood started out as a group project in my high school programming class, but over time, turned
				into a group learning experience. My group and I came up with the idea and were really excited about
				working together on a game, but we were all novice
				programmers. So, after a little Google search, we found <a href="http://www.stencyl.com/">Stencyl</a>: a
				code-block based program that allowed us to build a game without writing any code. Though we weren't
				typing the code, we built
				the logic behind it, using logic blocks. I was enthralled by the development of the game and began to
				work on it even during my time off school. Together, we built each block of code, sound, and art piece
				from scratch. After the first month,
				we were able to produce our first published version of the game and it can be played <a
					href="../projects/ff/fleshflood-first">here</a>.

				<img class="image1" src="../images/Flesh Flood/zombie.png"> We all saw a glimps of how much hard work is
				put into making even the simplest game. This glimps made me hunger for more experience. We continued to
				work together until graduation,
				but the game was never complete. This version of the game can be played <a
					href="../projects/ff/fleshflood-last">here</a>.

				<img class="image1" src="../images/Flesh Flood/mainmenu.png"> Knowing that our skills had improved
				drastically since we began, we decided to stray away from the logic block approach and began to recreate
				the game as a mobile application. To
				accomplish this task, we used CoronaSDK and lua as our tools. We also improve on the original, by adding
				new concepts like power-ups, rotating health, and touch-interactive gameplay. If you would like to play,
				you can download and play on your
				android device by clicking the link below.
