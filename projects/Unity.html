        <h2>Assignments From Computer Game Programming (COSC 439)</h2>
		<h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/Unity/Roll-A-Ball.html">Roll-A-Ball</a></h2>
		<p>
		This is the first assignment we were given. 
		It is a simple and short game that was built from following a tutorial. 
		The main purpose of this assignment was to familiarize our class with the basic elements of Unity's game engine. 
		The objective of the game is to collect all the spinning cubes.
		The tutorial I followed is located <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial/introduction-roll-ball">here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/Unity/ApplePicker.html">Apple Picker</a></h2>
		<p>
		The first prototype that I built and modded from Jeremy Bond's book <i>Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and C#</i>. 
		An apple tree drops apples worth 100 points and oranges worth 200 points. 
		If the player doesn't catch a piece of fruit, they will lose a basket. 
		After three baskets, the player loses.
		The objective of the game is to get the highest score.
		Modifications added: title screen, gameover screen, and oranges.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/Unity/MissionDemolition.html">Mission Demolition</a></h2>
		<p>
		The second prototype that I built and modded from Jeremy Bond's book <i>Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and C#</i>. 
		The game has a similar playstyle to Angry Birds.
		The player can send shots from the slingshot into the castles to eventually reach the green goal.
		When the goal is met, a new castle spawns.
		The player's objective is to obtain a highscore or aim to finish each castle.
		Modifications added: each shot subtracts points, yellow floating squares give extra points, some walls are more dense than others, and unique castles.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/Unity/SpaceSHMUP.html">Space SHMUP</a></h2>
		<p>
		This is the final prototype that I built and modded from Jeremy Bond's book <i>Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development: From Concept to Playable Game with Unity and C#</i>. 
		It is a game set in space, where the player attempts to surive for as long as possible.
		The player can shoot the ships to obtain power-ups and use his jet to speed through enemies.
		Modifications added: Jet speed boost, jet fuel indicator, sound effects, space ship designs, and enemies explode when they die.
		</p>
		
		<h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/Unity/Platformer.html">Platformer</a></h2>
		<p>
		The final project for this course. 
		We had free reign over the complete design of the game.
		Unfortunately, we only had a week to work on it, but it came to be a great game.
		It is a platformer similar to Mario Bros.
		The player must travel through the moving terrain and dodge enemies to ultimately get the pizza at the end of each level.
		When the goal is met, the player proceeds to the next level.
		The player's main objective is to obtain a all of the yellow collectables on each level, while reaching the end.
