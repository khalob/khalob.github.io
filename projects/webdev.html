		<h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/webdev/snake.html">Snake Game</a></h2>
		<p>
		I wanted to learn how to use canvas elements and javascript, so I made a two player snake game I made in my spare time. 
		Food spawns based on a timer and makes your character grow if you collide with it. 
		If you run into yourself or the other player, you lose.

        <h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/webdev/231/arsho.html">Arsho Hunts</a></h2>
        <p>
          Use Javascript, HTML and CSS to implement a simple game: Arsho is confined to her playpen. As she moves around her playpen, she can pick up cheerios and marshmallows. One cheerio picked up counts 1 point. One marshmallow picked up counts for 100 points.
          After 30 seconds, her final score is the total amount of points she has picked up. Uncle Tigran tosses cheerios and marshmallows into the playpen at random times and to random locations. If multiple items land on the same location, only the
          last item will count (other items that may have landed on the same space previously will disappear from view and will not count toward Arsho's score). All items must completely reside within the playpen -- you cannot have a part of a marshmallow.
          No item can land on Arsho's head -- if the random location happens to be Arsho's location, then calculate a different random location. Each available cheerio or marshmallow must be visible after it is calculated. There are no invisible items.
          Arsho has to maneuver over the top of a cheerio or marshmallow in order to pick it up. After Arsho moves over the top of an item, the item will disappear. Arsho will always be on top of items -- items will never land on her head. During each
          second of real time, there is a 1 in 3 chance of a cheerio appearing. During each second, there is a 1 in 5 chance of a marshmallow appearing. Thus, the maximum possible score is 610. Arsho's playpen is 500 X 500 pixels. Arsho herself, and each
          cheerio or marshmallow, occupy 25 X 25 pixels. This means, there are 20 X 20 actual locations (500 / 25 = 20) that can be used for positioning Arsho and treasure. The playpen must have an obvious border around it. Arsho's movement is controlled
          by the left, right, up down arrows. Each click of an arrow button will cause her to move in the indicated direction by 25 pixels (*only* 25 pixels). Arsho cannot be allowed to exit the playpen. Keep and display a running tally of Arsho's current
          score. When the 30 seconds completes, announce "Game over" with the score earned.

        <p>
          Named:HW0209.html Give a user a set of radio buttons: small jump (10), medium jump (60), big jump (110), and a 30 X 30 colored div. The div is approximately in the middle of the screen (you can hard code the initial position). The user selects a displacement,
          delta, from the radio buttons. When the user mouses over (onMouseOver event) the colored div, the div should move to a new location (given by top and left) that is a random (see javascript random() method ) displacement between [- (delta/2),
          + (delta/2) ). The colored div does not have to stay within the boundary of the screen. // Due 2/11/2016

        <h2><a href="http://khalob.github.io/projects/webdev/231/gallery.html">Picture Gallery</a></h2>
        <p>
          The first thumbnail is also highlighted, and its image is also displayed in a 200 X 200 div, also centered on the page. The large image also has a title with the name of the element of the Great Chain, e.g., "God", "Angel", "Commoner". There are two buttons,
          labelled "Next" and "Previous". The next button, when clicked, will advance, the previous button will retreat through the thumbnails. As the user moves forward or backward through the thumbnails, the new thumbnail is highlighted, and the corresponding
          image is displayed in the large div. Forward and backward will use wrap-around. The large image and the thumbnails cannot wiggle around while the user is moving through the images. You will implement this story using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
          You must make use of 1D array(s).
